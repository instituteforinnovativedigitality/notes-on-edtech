# Peer learning pedagogy
 - open, does it matter
 - accessible vs open


# Organizations & Communities
 - Open university
 - OERu
 - https://edulabs.de/ - Open source project for analyzing, developing, sharing, and filtering OER, could be very useful for us, both in terms of how they search/filter OER, and also their process for community-developed OER workshops
 - http://openpedagogy.org/ - New repository for open pedagogy practices; likely a kindred spirit in terms of how we want to see learning happen, could be good overlap to some of this work.
