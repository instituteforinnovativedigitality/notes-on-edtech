# Notes
 - No indication of what courses are openly licensed - is any?
 - Tool for discovering your learning path - not too bad - not sure why my gender was relevant?
 - Signed up for a course, but could only preview week 1 content - I couldn’t review the rest of the course - only the course overview on the ‘course catalogue’ page.
 - I managed to get into the course content by going to the course info page > expanding the course syllabus > expand the bit after “x videos, y readings” > and clicking the video link
 - It’s possible to download videos and transcripts of the videos when you are signed up to a course
 - Mostly video based - own video solution
