# Notes
 - Source code: https://github.com/edx/
 - Seems technically complex - lots of trendy tech
 - Videos hosted on YouTube as unlisted videos
 - Can download transcripts from YouTube, but would need a 3rd party tool / plugin to download video
 - Actually, seems like video can be downloaded for some courses - maybe the instructor can decide?
 - Interface and flow feels messy - this doesn’t seem that much better than courses.p2pu.org?
 - Survey using https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/
 - Discussion forum is basic, I posted, but didn’t try to browse/read
