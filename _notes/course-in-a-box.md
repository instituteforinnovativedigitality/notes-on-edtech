 - Functionality
  - 2 level content hierarchy
  - Content in Markdown
  - Full control over HTML
  - Arbitrary integration with surveys
 - No ‘running the course’ support. Need to use 3rd party tools for signup, discussion, etc.
 - No signin/signup
 - GitHub concepts + UI not ideal for course creators
